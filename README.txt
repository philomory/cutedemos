To run the demos, you'll need Gosu (libgosu.org), as well as my CellGrid 
library, which is available at http://bitbucket.org/philomory/cellgrid.

To run the demos, cd to the examples directory and run
	ruby example_runner.rb

Press a number 1-5 to switch between various demos. If you see a character, you
can use the arrow keys to move them around.

To use the nascent framework which the demos are are built with, you won't need 
CellGrid, but you may find it useful. Documentation will come when the whole
thing is more thoroughly developed.
